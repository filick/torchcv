# RRD for Oriented Scene Text Detection

This is a pytorch implementation of Rotation-Sensitive Regression Detector (RRD, [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05265)), based on [torchcv](https://github.com/kuangliu/torchcv). Probably we also add some skills used in [Textboxes++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02765).

## TODO
- [x] ORN in RRD
- [ ] inception block in RRD
- [x] support multiple scale in RRD
- [x] two-stage quadrilateral nms
- [x] ground truth mapping
- [x] data augmentation
- [x] loss function
- [x] train scripts
